title: Schedule snapshots and restore with more control, branch expiration, and project search

## Schedule snapshots and restore with more control

You can now schedule automated snapshots and restore from them using two flexible options:

- **One-step restore** — instantly restore a snapshot to the current branch
- **Multi-step restore** — restore to a new branch so you can inspect or test before finalizing

Both methods are available via the Neon API, making them ideal for workflows like AI agent checkpoints.

## Branch expiration for automatic cleanup

You can now set an expiration timestamp on branches to automatically delete them after a defined time. This helps keep environments clean and reduce storage usage for short-lived branches.

**How it works**  
Set an expiration timestamp (`expires_at`) when creating or updating a branch via the API, CLI, or Neon Console. Once the expiration time is reached, the branch and any associated compute endpoints are permanently deleted.

**Use cases**

- CI/CD pipelines that generate ephemeral test branches
- Time-boxed feature development
- Temporary demo or AI environments

## Easily find projects with new search field

Managing lots of Neon projects just got easier. You can now search for projects directly from the project page.
