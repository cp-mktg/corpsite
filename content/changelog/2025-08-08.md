title: Schedule snapshots and restore with more control, and branch expiration
---

## Schedule snapshots and restore with more control

You can now schedule automated snapshots and restore from them using two flexible options:

- **One-step restore** — instantly restore a snapshot to the current branch
- **Multi-step restore** — restore to a new branch so you can inspect or test before finalizing

Both methods are available via the Neon API, making them ideal for workflows like AI agent checkpoints.

## Branch expiration for automatic cleanup (Early Access)

You can now set an expiration timestamp on branches to automatically delete them after a defined time, helping keep projects clean and reduce storage costs for temporary branches.

To use, set an `expires_at` timestamp (RFC 3339) when creating or updating a branch via the API, CLI, or Neon Console, up to 30 days ahead. At expiration, the branch and its compute endpoints are permanently deleted.

**Use cases**

- CI/CD pipelines with ephemeral test branches
- Time-boxed feature development
- Temporary demos or testing environments
- AI workflows requiring automated cleanup
